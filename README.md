# Istumapaikat
Simple program to randomize seatings for teams in different rooms, for office switch or similar situations.

Categories in rooms/consumers csv-files:

0 standard

1 engineering

2 no sunlight

## Lenient seating

The istujat.csv contains the 'strict' column, which designates whether the team/person wants to be in only that category of seating or not - if not, the team/person could be randomized into a different category, if that category has no prioritized seaters left.
